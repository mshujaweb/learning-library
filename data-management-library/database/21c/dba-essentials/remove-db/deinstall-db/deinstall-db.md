# Deinstall Oracle Database

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps for stopping and removing the Oracle Database software and deleting the database.  

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

Remove the Oracle Database software, delete Oracle Database, and remove Oracle home from your host system using the *deinstall* command.

**Note:** If you have any user data in Oracle base or Oracle home locations, then `deinstall` deletes this data. Move your data and files outside Oracle base and Oracle home before running `deinstall`.  

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have -
- A Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Oracle Cloud account.
- Oracle Database 21c installed and configured.
- Completed all previous labs successfully.


## Task 1: Remove Oracle Database

To remove Oracle Database from your host system, do the following. 

1.  Log in to your host as *oracle*, the user who can remove Oracle Database.

2.  Change the current working directory to `$ORACLE_HOME/deinstall`. This is the directory where `deinstall` is located.  

    ```
	$ cd /u01/app/oracle/product/21.0.0/dbhome_1/deinstall
	```

	**Note:** Do not shut down the Oracle Database or stop any database processes before running `deinstall`.

3.  Start the Oracle Database deinstallation process with this command.  

    ```
	$ ./deinstall
	```

    **Note:** For every step, `deinstall` displays the default input values in brackets \[\]. You can either specify the values manually or press **Enter** to leave the default values and proceed.

    ```

4.  The `deinstall` command prompts to specify all single instance listeners that you want to deconfigure.  

    ```
	Specify all Single Instance listeners that are to be de-configured. Enter .(dot) to deselect all.
	[LISTENER]: **Enter**
	```

    Press **Enter** to remove the current listener.

    ```

5.  If you have multiple Database Instances in your Oracle home, then you can either delete specific database instances or remove all instances together using `deinstall`.   

    **Note:** To enter specific instance names that you want to delete, use comma as the separator. To remove all the instances, press **Enter**.

    ```
	Use comma as separator when specifying list of values as input
    Specify the list of database names that are configured in this Oracle home [orcl]: **Enter**
	```

    For this lab, press **Enter** to remove the default single instance database.

	## Output

    ```
	###### For Database 'orcl' ###### Single Instance Database The diagnostic destination location of the database: /u01/app/oracle/diag/rdbms/orcl Storage type used by the Database: FS Database file location: /u01/app/oracle/oradata/ORCL,/u01/app/oracle/recovery_area/ORCL Fast recovery area location: /u01/app/oracle/recovery_area/ORCL database spfile location: /u01/app/oracle/dbs/spfileorcl.ora
	```

6.  The `deinstall` command prompts you to modify the details of the discovered databases. The default value is *n* which means no.

    ```
	The details of database(s) orcl have been discovered automatically.
	Do you still want to modify the details of orcl database(s)? [n]: **Enter**
	```

    **Note:** If you enter `y` in this prompt, `deinstall` allows you to specify the details of your Oracle Database. You can manually enter each detail, such as the type of database, the diagnostic destination location, the storage type, the fast recovery area location, the spfile location, whether Archive Mode is enabled, and so on.  

    For this lab, press **Enter** to select the default value and `deinstall` automatically discovers the details of your Oracle Database.

	## Output

    ```

    Inventory Location where the Oracle home registered is: /u01/app/oraInventory

    The following databases were selected for de-configuration. The databases will be deleted and will not be useful upon de-configuration : orcl
    Database unique name : orcl

    ```

7.  The `deinstall` command prompts you to confirm removing your Oracle Database. 

    ```
    Do you want to continue (y - yes, n - no)? [n]:
    ```

    Enter *y* to initiate the removal process.

	**Note:** The default value is **n** which means no. If you directly press Enter or specify **n** here, then `deinstall` exits without removing the Oracle Database.   

    The deconfiguration clean operation creates log files and completes removing the database.

    The above message confirms that you have completed the deinstallation and deleted Oracle Database from your host. You can close the terminal window.

**Note:** The `deinstall` command deletes Oracle Database configuration files, user data, and fast recovery area (FRA) files even if they are located outside of the Oracle base directory path.

You have successfully completed this workshop on *Oracle Database 21c Deinstallation*. 

In this workshop, you have learned how to remove the database software, delete Oracle home and the database components, and remove Oracle Database from your host system.
