# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop shows how to develop a web application in Oracle Visual Builder for your users to view, create, and edit data. You'll see how to create a new web app, add pages to display your data, then link them to each other. You'll also create business objects to store your app's data and learn how to build pages to edit that data.

Estimated Time: 115 minutes

### What Is Oracle Visual Builder?

Oracle Visual Builder provides easy access to data from any REST-based service, and lets you create reusable business objects for storing and managing data. Using cloud-based visual development tools, you can create and test responsive web applications and native mobile apps without having to install any additional software. The visual designer enables you to quickly lay out pages in your applications by dragging and dropping UI components, customizing their attributes, and defining their behavior.
