# UI Access 

## Introduction

This lab explains the steps to deploy the UI access, that aready exists in your jupyter notebook to predict first 5 drivers for a given race. So this lab is just to explain what these files and their functions are doing to and for our model.      

Estimated Time: 60 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Deploy UI Access to predict first 5 drivers for a given race

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Free Tier, Always Free, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account


## **Task 1**: Deploy UI Access to predict first 5 drivers in a given race

Navigate to the ``` /redbull-analytics-hol/beginners/web ``` directory in your Jupyter Notebook session. Below we have provided a step-by-step explaination for deploying UI Access to predict first 5 drivers in a given race

1. In the ``` predictor.py ```, we first load the trained model and the dataset that we saved in the previous labs.

2. After loading the data, we have created a prediction method using python. Within the function we are making a call to 'predict', which is function of scikit-learn library.

3. Before executing or compiling anything, it's always a good idea to test, and that's what we're doing next. In the ``` testpredictor.py```, we’re feeding some input (testing with Silverstone results) to determine if it meets our expectations with respect to its output.

4. In the ``` app.py ``` , you can see, in this first call out, we see the predictor being called and then, in the second callout, we see an if function creating a server port to call the predictor itself.

  And it's important to note that the second call-out is executed first, which, after opening a server port, calls the predictor.

5. Let’s go back to the launcher/dashboard by clicking ```File > New > Launcher```, then click on the terminal icon you see called out in this screenshot.

6. Running the `start` terminal command in the callout here launches the webserver.If you need to stop the server for any reason, use the stop command you see in the call out. There aren’t many use cases where this would be useful during this lab, but it’s good to know.


  Execute next command to start:

    ```
    <copy>
    ./launchapp.sh start
    </copy>
    ```

  To stop:

    ```
    <copy>
    ./launchapp.sh stop
    </copy>
    ```

7. Now you can test using your VM IP: http://<xxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx>:8080/ . 

  Choose which track and weather you’d like to see reflected in your top 5 driver results. Ideally, your choices will determine the five drivers which will be listed after clicking Predict.

  Note that the XXXX you see in the title of this slide is the same IP you’ve used to access your Jupyter notebook. We’re just changing the 8001 to 8080 in a tab.

8. Here’s what you should see on your end after clicking the Predict button
