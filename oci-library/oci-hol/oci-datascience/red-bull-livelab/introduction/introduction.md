# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Red Bull Racing Honda, the four-time World Champion team, has chosen Oracle as their official cloud infrastructure and customer experience platform provider. [Read here for more information](https://www.oracle.com/redbullracing/)

Are you interested in learning machine learning (ML)? How about doing this in the context of the exciting world of racing?! Get your ML skills bootstrapped here with Oracle and Red Bull Racing!

This tutorial teaches ML analytics with a series of hands-on labs (HOLs) using the [Data Science](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/data-science.htm) service in [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://cloud.oracle.com/). You'll learn how to get data from some public data sources, then how to analyze this data using some of the latest ML techniques. In the process you'll build ML models and test them out in a predictor application.


Estimated Time: 5 hrs
